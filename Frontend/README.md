FrontEnd Applicaton

This is a website application for Accommodation Businesses focusing in the Wanaka Region.
The website has a login/sign up button for those who would like to book accommodation through the site.  Users can access this on the NavBar, or when they place a booking for one of the three accommodation offerings, the Book button will open up the Login/Signup window first to capture their username/password and their personal details for the User table.  Once this is complete the user will return to the bookings page.  Here the user can select their accommodation choice and the dates of their stay. This will populate the Bookings Table.

The reviews page is where previously registered users can log back in and leave a review. This Review table links to both the booking and user table through a foreign key.
